# Conquer Clone
 An HTML/CSS clone of the free Bootstrap Conquer theme from free-css.com/templatemo.
 Original template can be found here: https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page196/conquer.

Entry-level solo project for Chingu: https://github.com/chingu-voyages/soloproject-tier1-website-template

Written in plain HTML and CSS, this is a one-page template with different sections for various types of business information, with a parallax scrolling effect. Elements flex/shift with resizing. Sections include:

- Main hero image and heading section
- Section with feature cards (three-column section and two column-section)
- Services section
- Four-column and one-column card section
- Contact section
- Footer/information section

Clicking the navigation links leads to different parts of the page. Smooth scrolling is enabled with CSS.

Image files are placed in a seperate folder called "img", but otherwise all other files (just two) are in the same root folder.

Can be deployed as plain HTML and CSS files. The only dependency is Google Font's Open Sans font, which is linked in the <head>.
